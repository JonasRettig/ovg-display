A custom soulution for the OVG NRW to display current news, court dates and the weather on two displays in their building.

To run the project yourself you need to create a free API key for [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in) by registering there and navigating to the API section in your account. You need to add this key in the predetermined spot in the .env.template file provided and then rename this file to .env.

You can deploy this project with ```npm run build```, further information can be found on the website of the [Create React App Project](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/).
